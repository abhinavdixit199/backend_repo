show dbs to show the total databases
use x will make a collection named x
db.y.insertOne()/insertMany will make a document named y in active database that is x here
show collections will show you total documents in active collection
to see the data of document z use db.z.find()// .pretty is added to get data in a arranged syntax
to insert more than 1 data in a document use  db.s.insertMany([{},{},{}])

now we will see query selectors
   db.documentname.find(query ,projection)
   the syntax of queries like name:abhinav then only data in the above document with name:abhinav will show 
   the projection is like setting what from the above query have to be shown like if you set limit:1 then only 1 data of the document with specified query will show up
   in projection field setting any key to 0 will show all the thing except key and setting key to 1 will only show key from the above key value pairs in document data\
   there is also a method of .skip(n) where q skips n data matching the query
instead of setting limit =1 you can directly use db.documentname.findOne({})



***********************
to update  db.documentname.updateOne({filter},{update})
db.docuabhi.updateOne({name:abhinav}, {$set:{class:6}}) // it only updates one even if two have same name it only updates the top one

to updateMany is same
db.docuabhi.updateMany({type:frontend},{$set:{classs:9}})


// to delete
db.documentname>deleteOne/deleteMany({filter})
delete one will delete one 
delete many will delete many  if filter is given 
in case if filter is not given in deletemany it will delete the whole document data
